### **Date**:       April 2020 (during Covid-19 Shelter In Place Order)
### **Tools**:    R, RStudio
### **What is Covid-19 Plots Using R?**
Simple R plots taking data from two sources:
- [The Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/)
- [Johns Hopkins CSSE Covid-19 Data Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

The Johns Hopkins data is the basis for their amazing [Covid-19 Dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).  
The Covid Tracking Project data is used by reporters the world over, with data collected daily from the individual states by volunteers.

This project contains one .R file for each plot and one sample .jpeg image.
